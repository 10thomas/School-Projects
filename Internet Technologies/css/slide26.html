	<p>
		This page has a 'header', and a 'footer', and a 'paragraph'. But I want... a snarfgugl.
	</p>
	<p>
		(If you aren't familiar with it, a 'snarfgugl' is a piece of text that one pretends is special or unique, when it's actually just a contrived
		example, labelled with a ridiculously fake name)
	</p>
	<p>But we don't have an HTML tag for snarfgugl's. If only we could have some sort of generic block, and then make it be special...</p>
	<div class="snarfgugl">
		This is <i>totally</i> a snarfgugl. Look at its snarfiness! LOOK AT IT!
	</div>
	<p>
		Of course, if we wish to make something special inline, we'd need a way to identify that span of text... <span class='snarfgugl'>AHA!
		THAT'S SO <sup><small>(not)</small></sup> CLEVER!</span>
	</p>
	<p class="snarfgugl">
		Rather than a paragraph that contains snarfgugl-iness, this paragraph <em>is</em> also snarfgugl-y!
	</p>
	<footer>
		Copyright: 201... yeah. Like anyone wants to bother copying this!
