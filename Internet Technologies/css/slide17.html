	<h2>This is inside a section</h2>
	<p>
		Oh. hey. Look at how big the 'block' actually is!
	</p>
	<p>
		And there's such a large margin between each paragraph block. ... interesting... (also, this is a paragraph that <i>immediately</i> follows a paragraph)
	</p>
	<h2>(end of section)</h2>
	<article>
		I like articles.
		<p>
			Statement of paragraphicalness, within an article! (paragraphs with an <i>immediate</i> parent of article have a light-green background)
		</p>
		<section>
			Sectionation of the article?
			<p>
				Cohesive theme (paragraph) within a section, within an article. Any paragraph that's an ancestor of an article has green text (notice above!).
