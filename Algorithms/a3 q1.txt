1.
let s be the array from 0 to n-1
Let L be the length of the logest ascedning subsequence where index i is the last element of the subsequence

a) an approriate function
	travwrse the list of s, for each value compare all the values that are larger after it
	for each value that is greater continue on.
	each time it ascends increment the counter for that by 1.
	the value at the end that is largest is the largest ascending subseuquence


b) the recurrence is 
L(i)	= 1 + max { L(j)}	if 0 < j < i and s[i] > s[j]
	= 1 			if j does not decist
c) principle of optimality holds true
d) algortithm using the recursion
	max(L(i)) where 0 < i < n.
e) the program 
f) test program
